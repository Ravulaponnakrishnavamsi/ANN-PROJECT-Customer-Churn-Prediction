# COUSTMER CHURN PREDICTION 
### This is an interactive Streamlit web application that predicts whether a bank customer is likely to churn (leave the bank) based on their personal and financial details.
### The app uses a trained TensorFlow deep learning model, along with saved preprocessing tools (LabelEncoder, OneHotEncoder, and StandardScaler) to transform user inputs into model-ready features.'

Installation & Setup

Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/churn-prediction-app.git
cd churn-prediction-app
```

Create a virtual environment (recommended)
```
python -m venv venv
